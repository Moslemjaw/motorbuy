Car parts are typically categorized by the major systems they belong to, such as the engine, transmission, braking system, suspension and steering, electrical system, and body and interior. 
Core Systems
Engine Parts: These are the components that work together to generate power and make the car move. Key parts include the pistons, crankshaft, camshaft, cylinder head, valves, and spark plugs.
Transmission System Parts: The transmission manages and transfers the engine's power to the wheels. This category includes the transmission assembly, clutch, drive shaft, differential, and axles.
Braking System Parts: Crucial for safety, these components allow you to slow or stop the vehicle. Examples include brake pads and rotors/discs, calipers, brake lines, and the master cylinder.
Suspension and Steering Parts: These systems provide a smooth ride, control handling, and allow the driver to steer the vehicle. Key elements are shock absorbers/struts, springs, control arms, ball joints, and the steering gear.

Supporting Systems
Electrical System Parts: This system powers all electrical components and includes the battery, alternator, starter motor, wiring, sensors, and the electronic control units (ECUs).
Cooling System Parts: The cooling system prevents the engine from overheating. Main components include the radiator, water pump, thermostat, and coolant hoses.
Fuel System Parts: This system stores and delivers fuel to the engine. Parts include the fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel injectors, and fuel tank.
Exhaust System Parts: The exhaust system manages and filters the gases produced by the engine before releasing them. It features the exhaust manifold, catalytic converter, muffler, and tailpipe. 
Body, Interior, and Other Components
Body and Structure: This includes the main chassis and frame, as well as exterior panels like the hood, doors, and bumpers.
Interior Parts: Components found inside the cabin, such as seats, dashboards, seatbelts, airbags, and infotainment systems.
Wheels and Tires: The components that make contact with the road, including the tires, wheels/rims, and tire pressure sensors.
Lighting: All external and internal lights, such as headlights, taillights, brake lights, and indicator lights.
Chemical/Physical Accessories: Consumable fluids like coolant, brake fluid, antifreeze, and lubricating oil are also considered a category of parts.
