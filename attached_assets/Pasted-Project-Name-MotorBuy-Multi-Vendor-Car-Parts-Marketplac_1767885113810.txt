Project Name

MotorBuy – Multi-Vendor Car Parts Marketplace

Goal

Build a modern, scalable, multi-vendor car parts e-commerce platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Vite for the frontend.
The system must be production-ready, modular, and payment-gateway ready (integration added later via .env).

Frontend will later be hosted on Vercel, backend on Render.

User Roles

The system must support three roles:

1️⃣ Admin
2️⃣ Vendor
3️⃣ User (Customer / Guest)
Core Features
🔹 USER (CUSTOMER)
Authentication

Users can:

Create an account

Login / Logout

Checkout as Guest

Marketplace

Browse car parts by categories (e.g. Battery, Brake Pads, Oil Filters, etc.)

Each category page shows:

Products from multiple vendors

Clear comparison layout

Product Listing Page

Each product must display:

Product name

Brand

Vendor name (clickable → vendor profile)

Price

Warranty price (if applicable)

Description

Images (multiple)
